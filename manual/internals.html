This section explains how <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> is structured. You don't need to know
any of this to use the program, but it may come in handy if you want
to change it or contribute to its development (which you're heartily
encouraged to do).
</p><p>
<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> is implemented primarily in Python, with some C++
extensions. Extensive use
is made of Python unittest framework to keep everything working - each
Python file <code class="filename">foo.py</code> is accompanied by
<code class="filename">test_foo.py</code>, which contains unit tests for that
file's features. 'test.py' for each folder runs all of the tests.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Source Code Layout</h3></div></div></div><p>
The important directories in the source are:
</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1" class="informaltable"><colgroup><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Directory</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code class="filename">fract4d</code></p></td><td> <p>This contains all the non-GUI-related, relatively
platform-independent parts of the code. This is in case it ever needs
to be ported to another environment (eg run on a server without a GUI
as part of a cluster). Most of the files here are parts of the
compiler (see below). The main class which represents a fractal is in
<code class="filename">fractal.py</code>. This holds references to the compiled
code, the formula and colorfunc definitions, the parameters and the
colormap. It also handles loading and saving information from a
<code class="filename">.fct</code> file, and provides
wrappers for some of the gnarlier C++ extension functions. </p>
</td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="filename">fract4d/c</code></p></td><td> <p>This contains the C++ extension code which is compiled
to produce <code class="filename">fract4dc.so</code>. This is divided into a
set of classes which communicate primaily via interfaces. The main
responsibility of this code is to call the 'pointFunc' (the function
which calculates a single pixel) once for each point on the
image. This code also does the bulk of the '4D' manipulation -
<code class="filename">vectors.h</code> contains code for 4-vectors and 4x4
matrix math. This library also handles multi-threaded calculations,
parcelling out the work to multiple MTFractWorkers via the queue in
<code class="filename">threadpool.h</code></p> </td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="filename">fract4dgui</code></p></td><td> <p>This contains the python code which implements the
GUI. It uses PyGTK as the GUI toolkit. The earliest PyGTK we support
is 1.99, which has some annoying incompatibilities with newer PyGTK's
like 2.4. I need to work out whether to ditch the older library
altogether or try to come up with some wrappers to hide the
differences. Basically there's one class per dialog or custom control,
and a few other for utility purposes. The central class is
<code class="classname">gtkfractal</code>, which wraps a
<code class="classname">fractal</code> and displays the results of the
calculation in a window. </p> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p /></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Compiler</h3></div></div></div><p>The most complicated part of <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> is the compiler. This takes
as input an UltraFractal or Fractint formula file, and produces C
code. We then invoke a C compiler (eg gcc) to produce a shared library
containing code to generate the fractal which we dynamically load.
</p><p>
The UltraFractal manual is the best current description of the formula
file format, though there are some UltraFractal features which are not
yet supported. You can download it from <a href="http://www.ultrafractal.com/uf3-manual.zip" class="ulink" target="_top">here</a>.
</p><p>
The implementation is based on the outline in <em class="citetitle">Modern Compiler Implementation in ML: basic
techniques</em> (Appel 1997, Cambridge). It doesn't do any
optimization at this point, leaving that to the C compiler used as a
back-end. It would be worthwhile to do some simple optimization (eg
constant-folding, removing multiplication by 1.0) because the C
compiler refuses to do this to floating point numbers.</p><p>
Overall structure: The <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html" class="ulink" target="_top">PLY</a> package
is used to do lexing and SLR parsing - it's in
<code class="filename">lex.py</code> and
<code class="filename">yacc.py</code>. <code class="filename">fractlexer.py</code> and
<code class="filename">fractparser.py</code> are the lexer and parser
definitions, respectively. They produce as output an abstract syntax
tree (defined in the <code class="classname">Absyn</code> module). The
<code class="classname">Translate</code> module type-checks the code,
maintains the symbol table (<code class="filename">symbol.py</code>) and
converts it into an intermediate form (<code class="filename">ir.py</code>).
<code class="classname">Canon</code> performs several simplifying passes on
the IR to make it easier to deal with, then
<code class="classname">codegen</code> converts it into a linear sequence of
simple C instructions. <code class="filename">stdlib.py</code> contains the
'standard library' of mathematical functions, like cosh(z). It's at
this point that complex and hypercomplex variables are expanded out
into pairs of floating point numbers - the C code is oblivious to the
complex numbers. Finally we invoke the C compiler to convert to a
native code shared library.</p><p>
At runtime the different phases happen at different times. First, the
entire .frm file is lexed and parsed. Then when a particular formula
is selected, it's translated and syntax-checked. The actual code is
only generated just before the fractal is drawn. This phase is
repeated whenever the function parameters are changed (eg @fn1 is set
to 'cosh').
</p><p>
Probably the ugliest part of the code is the handling of
parameters. Numeric parameters like floats are passed in as an array,
and the C++ code and Python code need to collaborate to work out which
indices into this array correspond to which params- this is done by
sorting them into alphabetic order. In general this area is a bit of a
mess.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">Threading</h3></div></div></div><p>
One of the weirder parts of the code is how we deal with
threading. Basically we want the calculation of the fractal to happen
on a different thread (or multiple threads for SMP) from the main UI,
so you can interrupt at any point. This is complicated by the fact
that Python only allows a single thread in the Global Interpreter
Lock, and that PyGTK is often compiled by Linux distribution vendors
without thread support, meaning this lock is not released when running
the GTK main loop.
</p><p>
The way out of this is that the additional threads live only in the
C++ code, where they are invisible to the Python code and GTK. When
<code class="function">pycalc</code> is called with asynchronous=True, it spawns a
thread to do the calculation, which may in turn spawn more workers if
we want multiple threads. These all write to the image buffer and
report back what they're doing by writing messages into a pipe. This
pipe is added to the list of things the GTK main loop monitors, so
whenever a new message appears we get a callback into the gtkfractal
code, interleaved with the normal GTK events. We can interrupt a
calculation in progress by setting a var which the calculation threads
check frequently - they then abandon their work and quit.  </p><div style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;" class="warning"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p> Multiple threads and C++ exceptions do not coexist
well, at least on some of the libstdc++'s that <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> runs with. So the
C++ code can't throw exceptions or very odd things including crashes
will happen. </p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="formref.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bugs.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Formula Language Reference </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Bugs and Known Issues</td></tr></table></div>
